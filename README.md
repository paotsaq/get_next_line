## get_next_line will be easy, they said...

...and it actually was, if you keep it simple without any unnecessary foolishness ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Considering it was easy, do you have anything else to add?

Not really. My previous implementation was really ugly (I mean, *really ugly*). And since the school requires us to code the function in the exam, I figured best to give this a second try while also going for the bonus - which is very easy.
 
There is a slight compromise in the definition of the static variable - I'm assuming there are no lines longer than 4096 chars.
